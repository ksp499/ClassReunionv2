  		Hello Class of 1978. It's hard to believe it's been 40 years, where does the time go? I toook it upon myself to sponser this web-site to gather information and create discussion about a 40 year class reunion. If there is an intrest please post you comments below. If we want to have a reunion, we can take sugestions from the comments and create a poll here to help with the planning.
  		I can provide that support. We would still need someone still in the Farwell area to help with the orginization and planning.
  		Well, here it is. Have fun and comment away.
    </p>
