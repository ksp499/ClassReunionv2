# classReunion# ClassReunionv2

This is a small app to assist in the planning and orginization of 
a class reunion. 

Authorization is required for access to the main content of the website. Access will be limited to class members or associated people.

The initial app is designed to capture initial input from class members to decide if there is even an intrest in a reunion event and to orginize a planning group for the class.

Once the planning group has been determined, and general ideas have been developed, a poll page will be developed to gather information from the class to decide what events and venues are desired for the reunion.

There is a comment section for input from classmates.

Content includes class, class parent and faculty galleries from the year book.
